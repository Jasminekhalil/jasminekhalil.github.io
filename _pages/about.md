Hi! I'm a freshman at [PSU](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) with an intended major in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. My research interests are in GNNs, collaborative machine learning and optimization, as well as sustainable power and energy harvesting.

A copy of my CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/Jasmine_Khalil_CV.pdf).
