Hi! I'm a sophomore at [Penn State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) with an intended major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Mathematics. My research and project interests are related to deep learning integrated with the medical field.

I currently work as part of the Women in Engineering Program as a facilitator and mentor for freshmans and sophomores, and I am a member of the IEEE student chapter at Penn State. I also run an instagram page, @projectportfolio_, where I present the development and iterative process for my current and pervious projects, while motivating and collaborating with others in the process.

Below is a collection of my selected paintings.
