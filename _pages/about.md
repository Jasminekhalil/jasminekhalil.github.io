Hi! I'm a senior and Schreyer Honors Scholar at Penn State University, majoring in Electrical Engineering. 

I'm passionate about applying computer vision, robotics, and machine learning to advance healthcare delivery and improve patient safety. Through research experiences and hands-on projects, I've been part of developing technologies that enhance how we approach healthcare delivery in terms of both efficiency and accessibility. 

With a strong foundation in engineering and mathematics, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and translating technical concepts into practical solutions. I am eager to continue learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that drive meaningful advancements in medical technology and patient care.

Some recent research and professional experiences I have been involved in include:

 - Moncrief Summer Intern at the [Computational Visualization Center](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/computational-visualization-center/) under the mentorship of Dr. Chandrajit Bajaj at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. 
 - Conducting research as part of the [2024 DIMACS REU at Rutgers University](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~jk2264/) under the mentorship of Dr. Pierre C. Bellec.
 - Being a [Cornell/Break-Through Tech fellow](https://tech.cornell.edu/impact/break-through-tech/)
 - Working with applied AI/ML leads from [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai) to improve the prediction of future price movements of stocks and other financial instruments during the last ten minutes of the Nasdaq exchange trading session.

I am also the TA and coordinator for the Electrical Engineering first year seminar at Penn State, a member of the [Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) PSU student chapter](https://sites.psu.edu/hkneecs/), [Tau Beta Pi PSU student chapter](https://sites.psu.edu/tbppab/) and the [IEEE student chapter](https://sites.psu.edu/psuieee/) at Penn State.
