As part of my senior design project, I worked at Parker Hannifin as a manufacturing engineer where I automated their handvalve stem assembly line. The design included a GoFa from ABB robotics, a crimping press, a snap-ring press, multi-purpose grippers, feeding systems, and sensors for safety.

The components that were being manufactured are proprietary and therefore cannot be shared with the public. Many of the work that describes specific component designs (such as: simulations, CAD models, and certain equations) and so only the work that was approved is shown here. You can find a report of the project that was shared with faculty at UW Madison [here](/assets/pdf/HandvalveReport.pdf) and the slides for the final presentation that was delivered to faculty at UW Madison [here](/assets/pdf/HandvalvePresentation.pdf).
