For my final project for ME 548: Intro to Design Optimization, my classmate (Mitch Haglund) and I optimized the truss design of a bridge using MATLAB and SolidWorks, by minimizing the compliance of the truss system while satisfying volume, tensile stress, and compressive stress constraints. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/itsahmedkhalil/ME-548-Final-Project) and my report [here](/assets/pdf/BridgeDesignReport.pdf).
