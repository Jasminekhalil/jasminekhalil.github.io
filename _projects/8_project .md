title: Camera Projection, Triangulation, Epipolar Geometry Project
description: Developed and implemented techniques for 3D reconstruction from 2D images in a motion capture setup. Utilized camera calibration
parameters, triangulation, and the eight-point algorithm to recover spatial information about the scene and relationships between two
views.
